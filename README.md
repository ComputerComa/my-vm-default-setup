# my-vm-default-setup

A Script I use to setup vm's for the first time on debian based systems. 

to run 
````
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ComputerComa/my-vm-default-setup/main/first-run.sh && chmod +x first-run.sh && ./first-run.sh
````

and after entering zsh


```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ComputerComa/my-vm-default-setup/main/post-setup.sh && chmod +x post-setup.sh && ./post-setup.sh
```
